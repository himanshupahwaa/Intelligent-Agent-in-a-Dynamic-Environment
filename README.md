# Search-Algorithms-in-a-Dynamic-Environment
Developed 5 agents with different search strategies to find a successful path in a maze full of moving ghosts (BFS, DFS, A-Star Search, Bi-Directional Search, etc)
Each agent was developed to fit its specefic environment. I compared the success rates of each agent and concluded the reasons behind its performance.
Please refer to the **GhostMazeProject.pdf** for full description of this project.
